I interpret what users need by listening carefully to what they want and what problems they face, then turning those needs into simple steps we can follow. User stories are helpful because they show what the user wants in their own words. By using the format “As a user, I want feature so that benefit,” we make sure we focus on what matters most to the user. This helps us create programs that fix real problems, not just meet technical rules.
When developing programs, I start by figuring out what is needed, then set small, realistic goals that can be checked and shown quickly. I like working in cycles and getting regular feedback. Ways of working like planning short work periods, having daily team check-ins, reviewing progress, and looking back on what went well help the team stay focused, flexible, and work well together. In the future, I hope to keep using ways to organize tasks and review our work to set the right priorities and get better over time.
Being a good team member means using your skills and working hard while also helping others. It means talking clearly, being dependable, and respecting different opinions. A good team member joins in on conversations, helps solve problems, and shares what they know. In Agile teams, it also means being willing to adjust and try new things so the team can work together to make the best product.
